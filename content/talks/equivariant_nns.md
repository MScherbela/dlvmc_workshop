When learning a property from data, it is often useful or required that the model obeys symmetries of the underlying data.
E(3)-equivariant networks obey the symmetry of rotation and translation in 3D space. They are therefore a natural choice when modelling data in 3D space, e.g. atomic coordinates of a molecule or point clouds obtained from 3D imaging.
In this talk I plan to:

- Explain the concept of equivariance
- Describe the basic building blocks of an E(3) equivariant network
- Briefly discuss an application: Learning properties of molecules
