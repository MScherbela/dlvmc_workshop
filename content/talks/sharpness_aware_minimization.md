For overparameterized models, the training loss provides few guarantees on model generalization. 
Prior work already observed connections between the geometry of the loss landscape, in particular flatness of a minimizer, and generalization.
Sharpness-aware minimization attempts to make use of this property by simultaneously minimizing the loss value and loss sharpness.
