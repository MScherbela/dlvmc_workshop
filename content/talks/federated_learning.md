We give an overview of how to utilize multiple computational nodes in the training of a ML model. 
This question either arises because the model is too large to be handled on a single node, or because the data is inherently local to the clients (for example for privacy reasons) as it is the case for *federated learning*, which we will focus on. 
The field is young enough to be fresh and  nteresting, but old enough to have established survey papers:
