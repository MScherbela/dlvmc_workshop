The workshop will be held at the old chapel "Alte Kapelle" ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/WksSkh371xJrU7hH6)).

To get there, enter the University Campus from Alser Straße 2-4 and walk straight through court 1 (Hof 1) to the very end.
There in the arched passage you will find the entrance to the chapel (Alte Kapelle), which is located on the first floor.
The nearest tram station is "Lange Gasse" at which the trams 43, 44, 5 and 33 stop.
