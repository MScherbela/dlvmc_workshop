Gino Cassella;Imperial College London;Optimization challenges with FermiNet;Carrying out VMC calculations with neural network wavefunctions comes with a lot of optimization-related challenges which can go under-reported in final publications. These include mystery NaNs, energies not converging -- or worse, converging inconsistently, and poorly understood dependence on hyperparameter selection. In this talk I will offer a frank description of our experience with these issues, mainly in the context of periodic systems, and discuss the approaches we and others are taking to improve the situation.;1;09:45;45

Sebastian Sanokowski;University of Linz;Variational Annealing on Graphs for Combinatorial Optimization;"Several recent methods in unsupervised learning utilize probabilistic approaches to address combinatorial optimization (CO) problems by assuming statistical independence among solution variables. We demonstrate that this assumption imposes limitations on performance, particularly for challenging problem instances. Our findings support the notion that an autoregressive approach, which captures statistical dependencies among solution variables, achieves superior performance on popular CO problems. We introduce subgraph tokenization, a technique that represents the configuration of a set of solution variables using a single token. This tokenization method mitigates the drawback of the lengthy sequential sampling procedure inherent in autoregressive methods, while still maintaining expressive power. Notably, we provide theoretical justification for an annealed Free Energy regularization and empirically demonstrate its crucial role in facilitating efficient and stable learning.
(Note: We solve CO problems by formulating them as Ising Models)";2;15:15;45
Ji Chen;Peking University;Extending neural network quantum Monte Carlo towards condensed matter physics problems;I will discuss the latest developments to generalize the neural network wavefunction based methods to solid systems, and further improve the accuracy via diffusion Monte Carlo. I will discuss the implementation of effective core potentials within the neural network wavefunction to further reduce the computational cost of realistic chemical systems. How to compute interatomic force will also be discussed.;3;09:00;45
Wan Toung Lou;Imperial College London;Neural Wave Functions for Superfluids;"Understanding superfluidity remains a major goal of condensed matter physics. Here we tackle this challenge utilising the recently developed Fermionic neural network (FermiNet) wave function Ansatz for VMC calculations. We study the unitary Fermi gas, a system with strong, short-range, two-body interactions known to possess a superfluid ground state but difficult to describe quantitively. We demonstrate key limitations of the FermiNet Ansatz in studying the unitary Fermi gas and propose a simple modification that outperforms the original FermiNet significantly, giving highly accurate results. We prove mathematically that the new Ansatz is a strict generalisation of the original FermiNet architecture, despite the use of fewer parameters. Our approach shares several advantages with the FermiNet: the use of a neural network removes the need for an underlying basis set; and the flexibility of the network yields extremely accurate results within a variational quantum Monte Carlo framework that provides access to unbiased estimates of arbitrary ground-state expectation values. We discuss how the method can be extended to study other superfluids.";3;09:45;45
